# Week 1: Basic Math Functions in Python

## Objective
Implement fundamental mathematical functions in Python to build a strong foundation for future AI and machine learning concepts.

## Tasks

1. Implement a function `factorial(n)` that calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer n.
2. Create a function `fibonacci(n)` that returns the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
3. Implement a function `is_prime(n)` that determines whether a given number is prime.
4. Write a function `gcd(a, b)` that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
5. Create a function `lcm(a, b)` that calculates the least common multiple of two numbers.

## Guidelines

- Use only built-in Python functions and control structures.
- Include proper error handling for invalid inputs.
- Write clear and concise docstrings for each function.
- Ensure your code follows PEP 8 style guidelines.

## Bonus Challenge

Implement a function `prime_factors(n)` that returns a list of prime factors for a given number n.
