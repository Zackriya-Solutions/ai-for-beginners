# Week 3: Statistics and Probability

## Objective
Implement fundamental statistical and probability functions in Python to build a strong foundation for data analysis and machine learning concepts.

## Tasks

1. Implement a function `mean(data)` that calculates the arithmetic mean of a list of numbers.
2. Create a function `median(data)` that calculates the median of a list of numbers.
3. Implement a function `mode(data)` that finds the mode(s) of a list of numbers.
4. Write a function `standard_deviation(data)` that calculates the standard deviation of a list of numbers.
5. Create a function `correlation_coefficient(x, y)` that calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient between two lists of numbers.
6. Implement a function `binomial_probability(n, k, p)` that calculates the binomial probability of k successes in n trials with probability p.
7. Write a function `normal_pdf(x, mean, std_dev)` that calculates the probability density function of a normal distribution.

## Guidelines

- Use NumPy for efficient numerical computations.
- Include proper error handling for invalid inputs.
- Write clear and concise docstrings for each function.
- Ensure your code follows PEP 8 style guidelines.

## Bonus Challenge

Implement a function `bootstrap_mean_ci(data, num_bootstrap_samples, confidence_level)` that calculates the bootstrap confidence interval for the mean of a dataset.
