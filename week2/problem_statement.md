# Week 2: Linear Algebra Basics

## Objective
Implement fundamental linear algebra operations in Python, which are crucial for many AI and machine learning algorithms.

## Tasks

1. Implement a function `vector_add(v1, v2)` that adds two vectors.
2. Create a function `scalar_multiply(c, v)` that multiplies a vector by a scalar.
3. Implement a function `dot_product(v1, v2)` that calculates the dot product of two vectors.
4. Write a function `matrix_multiply(m1, m2)` that multiplies two matrices.
5. Create a function `transpose(matrix)` that returns the transpose of a matrix.
6. Implement a function `is_orthogonal(matrix)` that checks if a matrix is orthogonal.

## Guidelines

- Use NumPy for efficient array operations.
- Include proper error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., incompatible dimensions).
- Write clear and concise docstrings for each function.
- Ensure your code follows PEP 8 style guidelines.

## Bonus Challenge

Implement a function `eigenvalues(matrix)` that calculates the eigenvalues of a 2x2 or 3x3 matrix.
